    "      We observe that the market return is negatively skewed. This means that the median return is lower than the arithmetic mean. This indicates that unfavorable results in certain investments have had a significant impact on the overall index return. During the period of interest, several key events contributed to this negative skewness. Three major sectors of the index experienced substantial losses:\n",

VaR is computed by sorting the data points and selecting the value at the *x* percentile. Intuitively, data points at lower percentiles have lower values, indicating greater losses, while *100 - x%* of the data points are greater than the *x* percentile, signifying smaller losses or gains.\n",
