# Portfolio Yield Analysis

Welcome to my project on portfolio yield analysis! This page provides an overview of the strategies and methods used to assess various investment approaches.

## Overview

- **Leverage and Arbitrage**: Investigating the effects of borrowing to invest and taking advantage of market inefficiencies. [TODO: add remaining into Github]
- **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**: Applying MPT principles to optimize returns for a given level of risk.

## Data-Driven Analysis

- **Pandas, yfinance, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Leveraged these libraries to gather and process financial data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Collection**: Processed Yahoo Finance data for a range of assets to simulate portfolio performance.
- **Metrics**: Analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs), such as returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

## Highlights

- **Leveraging Strategies**: Quantified how leveraged positions can amplify returns (and risk).
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Explored potential arbitrage setups and measured their impact on overall portfolio performance.
- **MPT Implementation**: Constructed efficient frontiers and evaluated optimal asset allocations to maximize return per unit of risk.
